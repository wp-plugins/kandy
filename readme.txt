Kandy Plugin is a full-service cloud platform that enables real-time communications for business applications.

== Description ==
This WordPress plugin encapsulates Kandyâ€™s JS SDK and Restful APIs. Kandy is a product by GENBAND (www.genband.com) that utilizes WebRTC to enable peer to peer audio and video calls and chat. SMS and PSTN calling support will be added to this package in the near future.

<strong>FEATURES</strong>

<strong>KANDY</strong> makes use of a variety of Internet technology and for the most part you won't have to be concerned with how <strong>KANDY</strong> manages this and can focus solely on what you're trying to accomplish. However, it's helpful to understand some of the principles of how <strong>KANDY</strong> works.

* <strong>KANDY</strong>, of course, makes extensive usage of HTTP/HTTPS on ports 80/443 for much of it's communications between your clients/servers and the <strong>KANDY</strong> systems.

* Transactions with real-time media such as video and/or voice utilize the emerging standard of WebRTC. The <strong>KANDY</strong> libraries/SDKs manage all of the WebRTC transactions, so the developer can remain focused on the application. WebRTC is supported by Google's Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera. Microsoft's Internet Explorer does not support WebRTC and <strong>KANDY</strong> will shortly be providing a plug-in module to provide WebRTC support within IE.

* For some transactions (like instant messaging) and state information (presence), <strong>KANDY</strong> utilizes WebSockets or Long Polling depending upon the browser specifics. The <strong>KANDY</strong> JavaScript library creates these connections depending on your application regarding and will manage these without any requirement from your application.
